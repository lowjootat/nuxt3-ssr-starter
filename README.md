# Super simple SSR website with Nuxt 3 and CloudFlare

This repo is for programming newbies who want to create a simple SSR (Server Side Rendering) website (e.g. https://redditrecs.com ) with Nuxt 3 & CloudFlare.

I wrote this because I was once that programming newbie, and I was tearing my hair out because:
- Existing tutorials and documentations were overly complicated (for what I wanted to build)
- AI coding assistants suck at Nuxt 3

Hope this helps save someone’s hair!

## What you will build in this example walkthrough
By the end of the tutorial, you will have a live website that looks like this: https://nuxt3-ssr-starter.pages.dev/

The website is ugly as hell but that’s not the point.

The point is to learn the basics through building, so you can build more complex website with the same underlying principles.

The website is actually a simplified version of https://redditrecs.com .

The shape of the website is that the content (list of portable monitors and their details) is generated from a data source via api, and then rendered on the server side.
